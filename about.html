      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Oklahoma in a small town outside Tulsa. I've lived in Seattle for over 20 years. I've held many different jobs: from bartender/server to snowboard sales rep, brewery cellarman, stone/tile contractor, and most recently finished a 4.5 year stint as a contractor at Microsoft doing video compression for XBox.</p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I've attended University of Tulsa and Shoreline c.c. and taken numerous online courses or tutorials for javascript and other computer/web technologies</p>
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>I've taken one other course from CodeFellows and am otherwise self taught concerning technology.</p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I'm hoping to continue to pursue knowledge in javascript and eventually transition into a career in development.</p>
